<h1>Project Proposal Report: Predicting Customer Default in the Australian Banking Sector<a class="headerlink" href="#project-proposal-report-predicting-customer-default-in-the-australian-banking-sector" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="executive-summary">
<h2>Executive Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This report outlines a strategic project to develop a predictive model for customer default in a major Australian bank. With an estimated loan portfolio of AUD 500 million, the objective is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to identify high-risk customers, reduce default rates, and thereby decrease potential credit losses. With assumed cost estimates and anticipated returns, this initiative is expected to yield significant improvements in risk management and overall profitability.</p>
</section>
<section id="business-context-and-objectives">
<h2>Business Context and Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#business-context-and-objectives" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the competitive Australian lending environment, minimizing credit risk is a critical priority. Currently, the bank experiences a customer default rate of approximately 5%. Given the average loan size of AUD 250,000, the estimated annual exposure in defaults could be significant. By implementing a predictive model, the aim is to reduce the default rate by at least 1 percentage point, which, on a portfolio of AUD 500 million, translates to a reduction in potential default losses by approximately AUD 2.5 million per annum.</p>
<p>The key objectives are:
1. <strong>Improve Risk Assessment:</strong> Enhance existing credit risk frameworks by integrating predictive analytics.
2. <strong>Reduce Defaults:</strong> Identify customers at high risk of default, allowing proactive risk mitigation measures.
3. <strong>Increase Profitability:</strong> Decrease credit losses and optimize lending decisions, leading to improved financial performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="project-phasing-and-timeline">

<p>The project is designed to be executed over a 6-month period, divided into three primary phases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Data Collection &amp; Preparation (Month 1-2):</strong>
- <strong>Data Sources:</strong> Gather internal customer data (credit history, transaction records, and demographic information) and supplement with external credit bureau data.
- <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Invest in data validation, cleansing, and integration efforts to ensure data quality.
- <strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Estimated at AUD 50,000, covering data procurement, software tools, and specialist data engineering support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Development &amp; Validation (Month 3-4):</strong>
- <strong>Algorithm Selection:</strong> Evaluate several machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods) to identify the best fit for the dataset.
- <strong>Model Training:</strong> Utilize historical default data to train the model, optimizing for both precision and recall.
- <strong>Validation &amp; Testing:</strong> Implement robust cross-validation techniques and A/B testing against current risk models.
- <strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Approximately AUD 120,000, inclusive of internal data science hours, potential external consultancy fees, and computational resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment &amp; Monitoring (Month 5-6):</strong>
- <strong>Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrate the predictive model into the bank’s existing risk management system.
- <strong>Monitoring Framework:</strong> Develop dashboards and reporting tools to monitor model performance in real-time, ensuring ongoing accuracy and reliability.

<h1>Example Average Customer Default Financial Impact in Dollar Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#example-average-customer-default-financial-impact-in-dollar-terms" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Below is an illustration of the dollar impact of a customer default, using the average scenario described in the report (i.e., an average loan size of <strong>AUD 250,000</strong>, a portfolio of <strong>AUD 500 million</strong>, and an assumed recovery rate of around 50%):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Loan Principal and Interest:</strong>
For an average loan of <strong>AUD 250,000</strong>, if a customer defaults, the bank loses the remaining principal and the expected interest. Assuming that collateral or recovery efforts secure about 50% of the loan value, the bank incurs a <strong>net loss of roughly AUD 125,000</strong> per default.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Regulatory Requirements:</strong>
Banks must maintain reserves (loan loss provisions) that reflect expected losses. With an average loss of approximately <strong>AUD 125,000</strong> per default, if defaults rise by even 1% across the portfolio, the bank’s provisioning needs increase significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Calculation:</strong>
- Total loans = AUD 500 million / AUD 250,000 ≈ <strong>2,000 loans</strong>
- At a 5% default rate, about <strong>100 loans</strong> default.
- A 1 percentage point reduction (from 5% to 4%) equates to about <strong>20 fewer defaults</strong>.
- Direct saving in default losses = 20 defaults × AUD 125,000 ≈ <strong>AUD 2.5 million</strong> in avoided losses, which also helps reduce the required loan loss provisions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Additional Expenses:</strong>
In the event of a default, banks incur extra costs such as collection efforts, legal fees, and administrative overhead. Typically, these costs can add another <strong>5–10% of the defaulted loan’s value</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an average loan of <strong>AUD 250,000</strong>, this equates to an additional <strong>AUD 12,500 to AUD 25,000</strong> per default in recovery and legal expenses.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Capital Buffers:</strong>
A higher default rate forces the bank to allocate more capital as a buffer against potential losses. For every default leading to a net loss of about <strong>AUD 125,000</strong>, the bank may need to hold additional capital as a buffer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong>
Assuming an annual cost (or opportunity cost) of around <strong>3%</strong> on this tied-up capital, each default could indirectly cost the bank roughly <strong>AUD 3,750</strong> (i.e., 3% of AUD 125,000) in potential earnings foregone.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Market and Customer Trust:</strong>
While more challenging to quantify directly, a rising default rate can negatively affect the bank’s reputation. This could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increased Cost of Capital:</strong>
Investors may demand higher returns, indirectly raising financing costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential Revenue Losses:</strong>
Reduced customer confidence may result in fewer new accounts or loans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimated Impact:</strong>
Although variable, these factors could add an indirect cost of around <strong>1–2% of the loan’s value</strong> (approximately <strong>AUD 2,500 to AUD 5,000</strong> per default).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<section id="overall-impact-on-the-portfolio">
<h2>Overall Impact on the Portfolio<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-impact-on-the-portfolio" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the above, for an individual default on an average loan, the total economic impact might break down as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Direct Loss:</strong> ~AUD 125,000</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational/Recovery Costs:</strong> +AUD 12,500 to AUD 25,000</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunity Cost (Capital Reserve):</strong> +~AUD 3,750</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indirect/Reputational Impact:</strong> +AUD 2,500 to AUD 5,000</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that a single default could cost the bank between <strong>AUD 143,750 and AUD 158,750</strong> in combined direct and indirect expenses.</p>
<p>Extrapolating to the portfolio, a 1 percentage point improvement (i.e., 20 fewer defaults among 2,000 loans) could directly save around <strong>AUD 2.5 million</strong> and potentially more when considering the secondary impacts on operational and capital costs.</p>

<h1>APRA Obligations for Banks in Building Predictive Models<a class="headerlink" href="#apra-obligations-for-banks-in-building-predictive-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="introduction-and-importance-of-reporting-predictive-models-to-apra">
<h2>Introduction and Importance of Reporting Predictive Models to APRA<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-importance-of-reporting-predictive-models-to-apra" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In building predictive models—such as those used to forecast customer defaults—it is crucial for banks in Australia to comply with the regulatory framework established by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This framework mandates that models are developed, validated, and monitored rigorously to ensure effective risk management. Reporting these models to APRA is essential not only for maintaining internal control and transparency but also for safeguarding the bank’s financial health. Failure to report or adhere to these obligations can result in increased regulatory scrutiny, additional capital requirements, and potential intervention by APRA. Such lapses may undermine risk assessment processes, lead to misclassification of credit risks, and ultimately destabilize the bank’s operations, eroding confidence among regulators, investors, and the broader market.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-obligations">
<h2>Key Obligations<a class="headerlink" href="#key-obligations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Model Risk Management Framework</strong>
- Banks must establish a comprehensive model risk management framework covering the entire model lifecycle—from development and implementation to ongoing monitoring and review.
- The framework should include detailed policies, procedures, and internal controls that ensure models are fit for purpose and aligned with the bank’s overall risk management strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Validation and Independent Review</strong>
- All models, particularly those used in critical risk assessments such as credit risk models, are subject to rigorous validation.
- Banks are required to perform back-testing, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis to verify model performance.
- Independent internal or external review teams must validate model assumptions, data quality, and methodological soundness to ensure unbiased evaluation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation and Transparency</strong>
- Comprehensive documentation is mandatory. Banks must record model design, assumptions, data sources, methodologies, and limitations in detail.
- These records must be maintained in a manner that allows APRA to conduct thorough audits and examinations, ensuring transparency in model development and use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance and Oversight</strong>
- Strong governance structures are essential. The board of directors and senior management must be actively involved in overseeing the model risk management process.
- Clear lines of accountability must be established, ensuring that model-related issues are promptly identified, escalated, and addressed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Monitoring and Reporting</strong>
- Banks must continuously monitor model performance to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.
- Regular reporting on key performance indicators, validation outcomes, and any material deviations in model performance is required.
- These reports should be provided to senior management, the board, and, where applicable, to APRA as part of the bank’s regulatory obligations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capital Adequacy and Prudential Standards</strong>
- Predictive models, especially those influencing capital adequacy and risk-weighted asset calculations, must adhere to APRA’s prudential standards.
- Models must be robust enough to support accurate risk assessments. In cases where model performance is deficient, banks may be required to hold additional capital as a buffer.
- Relevant standards, such as those outlined in CPS 232 (Credit Risk) or similar guidelines, provide the framework for acceptable model risk management practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Response to Regulatory Changes</strong>
- Banks are obligated to remain updated on evolving APRA regulations and guidelines.
- Proactive measures, including periodic reviews and adjustments of the model risk management framework, are necessary to ensure continuous compliance with the latest regulatory requirements.
- Engagement with APRA through consultations or submissions may be required to align internal practices with regulatory expectations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By meeting these obligations, banks can better manage model risk, ensure robust risk assessment, and maintain the overall stability of the financial system. This not only safeguards the bank’s financial health but also upholds the confidence of regulators, investors, and the broader market.</p>
