Taxonomy of Reasoning Techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs)
===============================================================

Below is an expanded, comprehensive taxonomy of reasoning techniques in large language models (LLMs). This revised framework groups methods not only by how they structure or sequence reasoning but also by how they interact with external tools and feedback loops, as well as by their methods for self-assessment and improvement. Note that the field is rapidly evolving, so this taxonomy is both comprehensive and adaptable to new innovations.

1. Linear Reasoning Methods
----------------------------

These approaches guide the model to produce a single, sequential chain of reasoning steps:

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

  - **Basic CoT:** The model generates a series of intermediate steps that lead directly to the final answer.
  - **Self-Consistency:** Multiple CoT outputs are sampled, and the answer is determined by aggregating (e.g., majority vote) over these paths, increasing reliability.
  - **Least-to-Most Prompting:** Complex problems are decomposed into simpler subproblems solved sequentially; each solution informs the next step.
  - **Scratchpad Methods:** The model writes out intermediate calculations or thought processes as a “scratchpad” before giving a final response.

2. Structured and Hierarchical Reasoning Methods
--------------------------------------------------

These techniques organize reasoning along multiple paths or levels to capture complex problem structure:

- **Tree-of-Thought (ToT):**

  - **Tree Search:** The model explores several branching reasoning paths (using strategies like beam search or breadth-first search) and selects the most promising branch.
  - **Recursive ToT:** The branching process is applied recursively to manage deeply hierarchical or multi-layered problems.

- **Prompt Chaining / Decomposition:** The overall task is segmented into a sequence of interconnected sub-tasks (or chained prompts), with each prompt addressing part of the overall problem.

- **Graph-of-Thought Methods:** A more recent direction in which reasoning steps are connected in a graph structure—allowing for non-linear, cross-referential relationships among reasoning paths.

3. Interactive and Action-Based Reasoning Methods
--------------------------------------------------

These methods integrate reasoning with interactive actions or tool usage, enabling the model to both think and act:

- **ReAct (Reason+Act):**

  - **REACT Framework:** Combines chain-of-thought reasoning with explicit actions (such as querying an external API or executing code) to refine outcomes.
  - **Tool-Enhanced Prompting:** Pairs intermediate reasoning with calls to external tools (e.g., calculators, database queries) so that the final output is informed by both internal reasoning and external data.

- **Interactive Agents and Multi-Step Execution:** Models can maintain dialogues where they iteratively propose, test, and refine actions based on feedback from their environment.

4. Reflective and Self-Improvement Methods
-------------------------------------------

These techniques incorporate feedback loops where the model reviews or refines its own reasoning:

- **Reflection / Reflexion:**

  - **Reflective Reasoning:** The model is prompted to review its initial answer or thought process and then iteratively revise its response to correct errors or enhance clarity.
  - **Meta-Cognition / Self-Querying:** The model internally evaluates “Is this the best way to solve the problem?” and adjusts its reasoning process dynamically.

- **Self-Consistency Decoding:** Similar to CoT self-consistency but extended to incorporate reflection, where multiple reasoning paths are generated and the most consistent one is chosen.

- **Self-Refinement (Iterative Refinement):** The model generates a solution, then critiques or highlights weaknesses in its answer, and uses that critique to produce an improved final answer.

5. Retrieval-Augmented and External Knowledge Integration
------------------------------------------------------------

These methods combine internal reasoning with retrieval from external sources or knowledge bases:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The model retrieves relevant documents or facts from a database (or knowledge graph) and integrates this external information into its reasoning process.

- **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Combines RAG with structured knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs) to better connect disparate information and improve overall reasoning.

- **Tool Use and Code Execution:** The model can call external programs (such as Python code execution) to handle numerical, symbolic, or logical computations, effectively outsourcing part of its reasoning.

6. Prompt Engineering for Reasoning
-------------------------------------

Prompt design plays a crucial role in eliciting high-quality reasoning from LLMs:

- **In-Context Learning:** Using few-shot or zero-shot examples to prompt the model to “think” through a problem. Even a simple cue like “Let’s think step by step” can significantly enhance reasoning.

- **Automatic Prompt Generation and Optimization:** Algorithms that allow one LLM to generate or refine prompts for another, automating the search for the most effective reasoning prompts.

- **Instruction Tuning:** Fine-tuning models on datasets containing detailed reasoning instructions to improve both the quality and interpretability of the reasoning process.

7. Hybrid and Emergent Approaches
----------------------------------

Newer methods often blend multiple strategies to harness the best of each:

- **Hybrid Models:** Approaches that combine linear reasoning (CoT) with structured exploration (ToT) and interactive actions (ReAct) to tackle complex, multi-faceted tasks.

- **Multi-Modal and Multi-Agent Reasoning:** Incorporating different input types (e.g., text, images) or using multiple cooperating LLMs to solve parts of a problem collaboratively.

- **Emergent Reasoning Abilities:** Techniques that leverage scaling and in-context learning to unlock reasoning capabilities that only emerge when models reach a critical size.

8. Evaluation and Safety in Reasoning
---------------------------------------

Given the complexity of reasoning methods, robust evaluation is essential:

- **Verifiers and Reward Models:** Using outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) to evaluate the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps.

- **Self-Consistency and Cross-Validation:** Techniques that sample multiple reasoning paths to measure consistency and select the most reliable answer.

- **Transparency and Interpretability:** Methods aimed at “opening the black box” by making the internal chain of thought available (or at least summarized) for human review to ensure safe and trustworthy AI behavior.

Summary
-------

This comprehensive taxonomy organizes reasoning techniques in LLMs into categories that range from simple linear methods to complex, interactive, and reflective strategies. It also emphasizes the integration of external knowledge and the critical role of prompt engineering, while acknowledging that evaluation and safety remain key challenges as these models become more capable. As the field continues to advance, new techniques—especially hybrid and emergent approaches—will likely extend and refine this taxonomy even further.


Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
================================

Below is an explanation of one linear reasoning method—Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting—with an example and a small Python script using LangChain.

Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
-------------------------------------

Imagine the following question::

"If you have 3 apples in a basket and you add 2 more apples, how many apples do you have?"

A basic chain-of-thought process might work as follows:

1. **Step 1:** Identify the initial number of apples (3).
2. **Step 2:** Recognize that you are adding 2 more apples.
3. **Step 3:** Compute the sum: 3 + 2 = 5.
4. **Final Answer:** There are 5 apples in the basket.

This sequential breakdown helps the model “think” through the problem step by step before arriving at the final answer.

Implementing Chain-of-Thought with LangChain
---------------------------------------------

Below is a small Python script that demonstrates how to implement a chain-of-thought approach using LangChain:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.llms import OpenAI
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  # Define a prompt template with a chain-of-thought structure
  cot_template = """
  You are a helpful assistant that thinks step-by-step.
  Question: 
  Let's work through this problem step by step:

  Step 1: Identify what is being asked.
  Step 2: Break down the question into smaller parts.
  Step 3: Solve each part.
  Step 4: Combine the results to get the final answer.

  Now, think aloud and provide your reasoning before giving the final answer.

  Final Answer:
  """

  prompt = PromptTemplate(template=cot_template, input_variables=["question"])

  # Initialize the LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT model)
  llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)  # Adjust temperature for diversity in reasoning

  # Create the LLMChain with the prompt and the LLM
  chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

  # Define the question
  question = "If you have 3 apples and you add 2 more apples, how many apples do you have?"

  # Run the chain to generate the chain-of-thought reasoning and answer
  response = chain.run(question)
  print(response)

How This Script Works
----------------------

- **Prompt Template:** The template instructs the model to break down the problem into a sequence of reasoning steps.
- **LLMChain:** The chain ties together the language model (here, an instance of OpenAI's model) with the chain-of-thought prompt.
- **Execution:** When run, the model outputs its step-by-step thought process before concluding with the final answer.

This basic setup can be extended with techniques such as **Self-Consistency** (by sampling multiple outputs and aggregating them) or **Least-to-Most Prompting** (by breaking down even more complex problems) as needed.


Structured and Hierarchical Reasoning Methods in LangChain
===========================================================

These methods help break down complex reasoning problems into structured forms, allowing LLMs to process and reason effectively. Below, each method is explained with an example and a Python script using LangChain.

1. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)
-------------------------

Tree-of-Thought (ToT) organizes reasoning into a tree-like structure where each node represents a thought, and multiple paths are explored.

Example: Solving a Complex Math Word Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine we need to solve a problem like:

"A farmer has 50 apples. He sells some and then buys twice the amount he sold. He ends up with 80 apples. How many did he sell?"

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we use a tree search approach (beam search) to explore multiple possible solution paths.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain
  from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
  from langchain.tools import Tool
  import os

  # Initialize LLM
  llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7, model="gpt-4")

  # Tree search prompt
  tree_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["problem"],
    template=""" 
    Given the problem: ""
    Let's break it down into different solution paths step by step.

    1. Identify what is known and unknown.
    2. Create possible solution branches.
    3. Evaluate which solution path makes the most sense.

    Provide reasoning at each step.
    """
  )

  tree_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=tree_prompt)

  # Example problem
  problem = "A farmer has 50 apples. He sells some and then buys twice the amount he sold. He ends up with 80 apples. How many did he sell?"

  # Run ToT chain
  response = tree_chain.run(problem)
  print(response)

2. Recursive Tree-of-Thought (Recursive ToT)
---------------------------------------------

Recursive ToT applies the tree structure at multiple levels, refining answers progressively.

Example: Debugging a Code Snippet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine we have a buggy Python function that we need to debug. Instead of a single-step fix, we recursively refine solutions.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we apply recursive reasoning to analyze and fix a Python function.

.. code-block:: python

  recursive_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["code_snippet"],
    template=""" 
    Given the following buggy code:

    .. code-block:: python


    Let's analyze and recursively improve it:

    1. Identify the potential errors.
    2. Suggest corrections.
    3. Refine the solution until the code runs correctly.

    Provide step-by-step reasoning and improved code at each stage.
    """
  )

  recursive_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=recursive_prompt)

  buggy_code = """
  def divide_numbers(a, b):
    return a / b
  print(divide_numbers(5, 0))
  """

  response = recursive_chain.run(buggy_code)
  print(response)

3. Prompt Chaining / Decomposition
------------------------------------

Prompt chaining breaks down a complex task into sub-tasks where each prompt's output feeds into the next.

Example: Writing a Research Paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We decompose the task into:

1. Generating an outline.
2. Expanding each section.
3. Refining and summarizing.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we chain prompts to build a structured research paper.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain

  # Outline generation
  outline_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["topic"],
    template="Generate a structured outline for a research paper on ''."
  )

  outline_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=outline_prompt)

  # Expand sections
  expand_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["outline"],
    template="Expand the following outline into a detailed research paper draft:\n\n"
  )

  expand_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=expand_prompt)

  # Chain them together
  chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[outline_chain, expand_chain], verbose=True)

  # Run the chain
  response = chain.run("Quantum Computing")
  print(response)

4. Graph-of-Thought Methods
----------------------------

Graph-of-Thought (GoT) structures reasoning into a graph, allowing for non-linear relationships and interconnections.

Example: Diagnosing a Technical Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of a single path, we explore multiple reasoning paths and cross-check relationships.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we use an agent-based approach to explore different reasoning paths.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.graphs import NetworkxGraph
  import networkx as nx

  # Create a graph structure
  graph = nx.DiGraph()
  graph.add_edges_from([
    ("User Reports Issue", "Check Logs"),
    ("Check Logs", "Identify Error"),
    ("Identify Error", "Suggest Fix"),
    ("Check Logs", "Check Configuration"),
    ("Check Configuration", "Suggest Fix"),
  ])

  # Initialize graph reasoning
  nx_graph = NetworkxGraph(graph=graph)

  # Define reasoning agent
  def diagnose_issue(query):
    path = nx.shortest_path(graph, "User Reports Issue", "Suggest Fix")
    return f"Following the reasoning path: , we diagnose: Potential misconfiguration."

  # Run diagnosis
  issue = "Website is not loading"
  diagnosis = diagnose_issue(issue)
  print(diagnosis)

Interactive and Action-Based Reasoning Methods in LangChain
=============================================================

These methods enhance reasoning by allowing LLMs to interact with external tools, execute actions, and refine responses dynamically.

1. ReAct (Reason + Act)
------------------------

ReAct integrates reasoning and actions in an iterative loop. The model reasons through a problem and takes actions (such as querying APIs, executing code, or searching for information) before reasoning again based on the retrieved data.

Example: Fetching Real-Time Weather Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let’s say we want to get the weather for a given city. Instead of just relying on model knowledge, we will use ReAct to:

1. Think about what information is needed.
2. Query a weather API.
3. Process the response.
4. Generate an informed answer.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using LangChain’s agent framework, we create a ReAct-based agent that queries an API.  **Note:** Replace ``YOUR_API_KEY`` with a valid API key from a weather service.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
  from langchain.tools import Tool
  import requests

  # Define an external tool to fetch real-time weather
  def get_weather(city: str):
    api_url = f"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={city}"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
      data = response.json()
      return f"The weather in {city} is {data['current']['condition']['text']} with a temperature of {data['current']['temp_c']}°C."
    else:
      return "Failed to retrieve weather data."

  # Register tool
  weather_tool = Tool(
    name="Weather API",
    func=get_weather,
    description="Gets real-time weather data for a given city."
  )

  # Initialize the ReAct agent
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)
  agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[weather_tool],
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
  )

  # Ask the agent a weather-related question
  response = agent.run("What's the weather like in New York?")
  print(response)

2. Tool-Enhanced Prompting
---------------------------

This method pairs reasoning with external tool usage, such as using a calculator, searching databases, or retrieving real-time data.

Example: Using a Calculator for Complex Math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of relying on the LLM’s built-in knowledge, we use a calculator tool for precise calculations.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We create a simple agent that uses an external Python calculator.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.tools import Tool
  import math

  # Define a calculator tool
  def calculator(expression: str):
    try:
      return eval(expression)
    except Exception as e:
      return f"Error in calculation: {str(e)}"

  # Register the tool
  calc_tool = Tool(
    name="Calculator",
    func=calculator,
    description="Evaluates mathematical expressions."
  )

  # Initialize an agent with the calculator tool
  agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[calc_tool],
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
  )

  # Example math problem
  response = agent.run("What is the square root of (256 + 144)?")
  print(response)

3. Interactive Agents and Multi-Step Execution
-------------------------------------------------

This approach enables models to propose, test, and refine actions dynamically based on iterative feedback.

Example: Debugging a Python Script Step-by-Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An agent interacts with a buggy script, refines its understanding, and progressively improves the solution.

Implementation in LangChain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we implement an agent that iteratively refines a Python script.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
  from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  # Define a debugging prompt
  debug_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["code"],
    template="""
    The following Python code has an error:

    .. code-block:: python


    Step-by-step, analyze the issue, propose a fix, and iterate until the code is correct.
    Provide detailed reasoning at each step.
    """
  )

  # Define an LLM chain for debugging
  debug_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=debug_prompt)

  # Example buggy code
  buggy_code = """
  def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
  print(divide(10, 0))
  """

  # Run debugging agent
  response = debug_chain.run(buggy_code)
  print(response)

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| **Method**         | **Example Use Case**        | **LangChain Implementation**         |
+=============================+=====================================+==============================================+
| **ReAct (Reason + Act)**  | Fetching real-time weather     | Uses ``initialize_agent`` with API calls   |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

Reflective and Self-Improvement Methods
===========================================

These techniques integrate feedback loops where the model reviews or refines its own reasoning, improving its accuracy over multiple iterations.

1. Reflection / Reflexion
-------------------------------------------

Reflection-based reasoning allows the model to critically review its output and iteratively refine its response.

Sub-methods:

- **Reflective Reasoning:** The model analyzes its initial answer, identifies weaknesses, and revises its response to improve accuracy.

- **Meta-Cognition / Self-Querying:** The model internally questions its own reasoning, asking, *"Is this the best way to solve this?"*, and dynamically adjusts its thought process.

Example: Improving a Short Answer Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the question:

*"What is the significance of the Renaissance?"*

Initially, the model may give a generic answer. Reflection allows it to review and improve its response.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain

  # Initialize LLM
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)

  # Reflection prompt
  reflect_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question", "answer"],
    template="""
    Original question: {question}
    Initial answer: {answer}

    Now, critically analyze this response:
    - Identify any missing key points.
    - Suggest refinements for a more comprehensive and insightful answer.

    Provide the improved response.
    """
  )

  reflect_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reflect_prompt)

  # Initial answer
  initial_answer = "The Renaissance was a cultural movement that emphasized art, science, and humanism."

  # Run reflection loop
  improved_answer = reflect_chain.run(question="What is the significance of the Renaissance?", answer=initial_answer)
  print(improved_answer)

2. Self-Consistency Decoding
-------------------------------------------

This technique generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most *consistent* answer. Unlike basic Chain-of-Thought (CoT), it incorporates self-reflection before deciding the best answer.

Example: Solving a Tricky Riddle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*"A father and son are in a car accident. The father dies, and the son is taken to the hospital. The doctor says, 'I cannot operate on this boy, he is my son.' How is this possible?"*

By generating multiple explanations and selecting the most consistent one, the model avoids incorrect assumptions.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
  from random import choice

  # Define multiple reasoning paths
  reasoning_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["riddle"],
    template="""
    Here is a riddle: {riddle}

    Generate three different possible explanations for the answer.
    """
  )

  selection_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["explanations"],
    template="""
    Given the following explanations:

    {explanations}

    Which one makes the most logical sense? Choose the best explanation.
    """
  )

  llm_chain_1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reasoning_prompt)
  llm_chain_2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=selection_prompt)

  chain = SequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain_1, llm_chain_2], verbose=True)

  # Run self-consistency decoding
  best_answer = chain.run(riddle="A father and son are in a car accident...")
  print(best_answer)

3. Self-Refinement (Iterative Refinement)
-------------------------------------------

The model critiques its own response, highlights flaws, and iteratively refines its output.

Example: Debugging a Python Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine we have a buggy function and want to refine it through self-improvement.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

  # Self-refinement prompt
  refine_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["code"],
    template="""
    Here is a Python function:

    ```python
    {code}
    ```

    Step 1: Identify any errors or inefficiencies in this function.
    Step 2: Propose improvements and refine the code.
    Step 3: Ensure the improved version is both correct and optimized.

    Provide the improved function.
    """
  )

  refine_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=refine_prompt)

  # Example buggy code
  buggy_code = """
  def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
      return 0
    else:
      return n * factorial(n-1)
  """

  # Run refinement loop
  refined_code = refine_chain.run(code=buggy_code)
  print(refined_code)

| **Method**              | **LangChain Implementation**    |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Retrieval-Augmented and External Knowledge Integration
============================================================

These methods enhance reasoning by incorporating external sources, structured knowledge, and computational tools, allowing the model to retrieve, analyze, and integrate relevant information.

1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
------------------------------------------------------------

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves response accuracy by dynamically fetching relevant documents or knowledge from an external database, allowing the model to ground its responses in real-world facts.

Example: Answering a Question Using a Document Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we want to answer the question:

*"What are the key principles of quantum mechanics?"*

Instead of relying solely on model knowledge, we retrieve documents from a knowledge base.  This example requires a ``quantum_mechanics.txt`` file containing relevant text.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
  from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
  from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
  from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

  # Load documents into FAISS vector store
  loader = TextLoader("quantum_mechanics.txt")  # Assume this file contains quantum mechanics principles
  docs = loader.load()
  vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

  # Initialize LLM
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

  # Create Retrieval-Augmented QA Chain
  qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())

  # Query the knowledge base
  response = qa_chain.run("What are the key principles of quantum mechanics?")
  print(response)

2. Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation
------------------------------------------------------------

Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation extends RAG by incorporating structured knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), allowing for better information organization and enhanced reasoning.

Example: Understanding Relationships in Historical Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a scenario where we query a knowledge graph to find the connections between historical figures and events. This example requires a Neo4j database setup.  Replace connection details with your database credentials.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.graphs import Neo4jGraph
  from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain

  # Connect to Neo4j Knowledge Graph
  graph = Neo4jGraph(
    url="bolt://localhost:7687",
    username="neo4j",
    password="password"
  )

  # Define QA Chain using the graph
  graph_qa_chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(llm, graph=graph)

  # Query the graph for historical connections
  response = graph_qa_chain.run("How is Albert Einstein connected to World War II?")
  print(response)

3. Tool Use and Code Execution
------------------------------------------------------------

This method allows the model to call external programs (such as Python scripts) to perform calculations, execute symbolic logic, or analyze datasets.

Example: Computing Fibonacci Numbers Dynamically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of reasoning symbolically, the model offloads the calculation to Python.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.tools import Tool

  # Define an external tool for Fibonacci computation
  def fibonacci(n: int):
    if n <= 0:

Prompt Engineering for Reasoning
=============================================

Prompt design plays a crucial role in eliciting high-quality reasoning from LLMs. Carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance the model’s ability to reason through complex problems.

1. In-Context Learning
-------------------------------------------------------------

In-Context Learning (ICL) improves reasoning by providing examples or explicit instructions on how to think through a problem. This can be:

- **Few-Shot Learning:** Providing a few examples before asking a question.
- **Zero-Shot Learning with Reasoning Cues:** Using phrases like *"Let's think step by step"* to guide the model.

Example: Solving a Logical Puzzle Using Step-by-Step Thinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the problem:

*"A man has four daughters, and each daughter has a brother. How many children does the man have?"*

The model is guided to break down the problem step by step.

LangChain Implementation:

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain

  # Initialize LLM
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.3)

  # Step-by-step prompt template
  reasoning_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["problem"],
    template="""
    Solve the following problem step by step:

    {problem}

    First, identify key details in the problem.
    Next, analyze how the elements relate to each other.
    Finally, provide a well-reasoned conclusion.
    """
  )

  chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reasoning_prompt)

  # Example logical puzzle
  response = chain.run("A man has four daughters, and each daughter has a brother. How many children does the man have?")
  print(response)

2. Automatic Prompt Generation and Optimization
-------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of manually crafting the best prompt, another LLM can be used to generate and refine prompts, optimizing for clarity, effectiveness, and reasoning quality.

Example: Refining a Math Word Problem Prompt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use one LLM to generate a problem-solving prompt and another to critique... (The response was truncated because it has reached the token limit. Try to increase the token limit if you need a longer response.)
