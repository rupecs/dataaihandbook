Taxonomy of Reasoning Techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs)
===============================================================

Below is an expanded, comprehensive taxonomy of reasoning techniques in large language models (LLMs). This revised framework groups methods not only by how they structure or sequence reasoning but also by how they interact with external tools and feedback loops, as well as by their methods for self-assessment and improvement. Note that the field is rapidly evolving, so this taxonomy is both comprehensive and adaptable to new innovations.

1. Linear Reasoning Methods
----------------------------

These approaches guide the model to produce a single, sequential chain of reasoning steps:

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  
  - **Basic CoT:**  
    The model generates a series of intermediate steps that lead directly to the final answer.
  
  - **Self-Consistency:**  
    Multiple CoT outputs are sampled, and the answer is determined by aggregating (e.g., majority vote) over these paths, increasing reliability.
  
  - **Least-to-Most Prompting:**  
    Complex problems are decomposed into simpler subproblems solved sequentially; each solution informs the next step.
  
  - **Scratchpad Methods:**  
    The model writes out intermediate calculations or thought processes as a “scratchpad” before giving a final response.

2. Structured and Hierarchical Reasoning Methods
--------------------------------------------------

These techniques organize reasoning along multiple paths or levels to capture complex problem structure:

- **Tree-of-Thought (ToT):**
  
  - **Tree Search:**  
    The model explores several branching reasoning paths (using strategies like beam search or breadth-first search) and selects the most promising branch.
  
  - **Recursive ToT:**  
    The branching process is applied recursively to manage deeply hierarchical or multi-layered problems.

- **Prompt Chaining / Decomposition:**  
  The overall task is segmented into a sequence of interconnected sub-tasks (or chained prompts), with each prompt addressing part of the overall problem.

- **Graph-of-Thought Methods:**  
  A more recent direction in which reasoning steps are connected in a graph structure—allowing for non-linear, cross-referential relationships among reasoning paths.

3. Interactive and Action-Based Reasoning Methods
--------------------------------------------------

These methods integrate reasoning with interactive actions or tool usage, enabling the model to both think and act:

- **ReAct (Reason+Act):**
  
  - **REACT Framework:**  
    Combines chain-of-thought reasoning with explicit actions (such as querying an external API or executing code) to refine outcomes.
  
  - **Tool-Enhanced Prompting:**  
    Pairs intermediate reasoning with calls to external tools (e.g., calculators, database queries) so that the final output is informed by both internal reasoning and external data.

- **Interactive Agents and Multi-Step Execution:**  
  Models can maintain dialogues where they iteratively propose, test, and refine actions based on feedback from their environment.

4. Reflective and Self-Improvement Methods
-------------------------------------------

These techniques incorporate feedback loops where the model reviews or refines its own reasoning:

- **Reflection / Reflexion:**
  
  - **Reflective Reasoning:**  
    The model is prompted to review its initial answer or thought process and then iteratively revise its response to correct errors or enhance clarity.
  
  - **Meta-Cognition / Self-Querying:**  
    The model internally evaluates “Is this the best way to solve the problem?” and adjusts its reasoning process dynamically.

- **Self-Consistency Decoding:**  
  Similar to CoT self-consistency but extended to incorporate reflection, where multiple reasoning paths are generated and the most consistent one is chosen.

- **Self-Refinement (Iterative Refinement):**  
  The model generates a solution, then critiques or highlights weaknesses in its answer, and uses that critique to produce an improved final answer.

5. Retrieval-Augmented and External Knowledge Integration
------------------------------------------------------------

These methods combine internal reasoning with retrieval from external sources or knowledge bases:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  The model retrieves relevant documents or facts from a database (or knowledge graph) and integrates this external information into its reasoning process.

- **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation:**  
  Combines RAG with structured knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs) to better connect disparate information and improve overall reasoning.

- **Tool Use and Code Execution:**  
  The model can call external programs (such as Python code execution) to handle numerical, symbolic, or logical computations, effectively outsourcing part of its reasoning.

6. Prompt Engineering for Reasoning
-------------------------------------

Prompt design plays a crucial role in eliciting high-quality reasoning from LLMs:

- **In-Context Learning:**  
  Using few-shot or zero-shot examples to prompt the model to “think” through a problem. Even a simple cue like “Let’s think step by step” can significantly enhance reasoning.

- **Automatic Prompt Generation and Optimization:**  
  Algorithms that allow one LLM to generate or refine prompts for another, automating the search for the most effective reasoning prompts.

- **Instruction Tuning:**  
  Fine-tuning models on datasets containing detailed reasoning instructions to improve both the quality and interpretability of the reasoning process.

7. Hybrid and Emergent Approaches
----------------------------------

Newer methods often blend multiple strategies to harness the best of each:

- **Hybrid Models:**  
  Approaches that combine linear reasoning (CoT) with structured exploration (ToT) and interactive actions (ReAct) to tackle complex, multi-faceted tasks.

- **Multi-Modal and Multi-Agent Reasoning:**  
  Incorporating different input types (e.g., text, images) or using multiple cooperating LLMs to solve parts of a problem collaboratively.

- **Emergent Reasoning Abilities:**  
  Techniques that leverage scaling and in-context learning to unlock reasoning capabilities that only emerge when models reach a critical size.

8. Evaluation and Safety in Reasoning
---------------------------------------

Given the complexity of reasoning methods, robust evaluation is essential:

- **Verifiers and Reward Models:**  
  Using outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) to evaluate the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps.

- **Self-Consistency and Cross-Validation:**  
  Techniques that sample multiple reasoning paths to measure consistency and select the most reliable answer.

- **Transparency and Interpretability:**  
  Methods aimed at “opening the black box” by making the internal chain of thought available (or at least summarized) for human review to ensure safe and trustworthy AI behavior.

Summary
-------

This comprehensive taxonomy organizes reasoning techniques in LLMs into categories that range from simple linear methods to complex, interactive, and reflective strategies. It also emphasizes the integration of external knowledge and the critical role of prompt engineering, while acknowledging that evaluation and safety remain key challenges as these models become more capable. As the field continues to advance, new techniques—especially hybrid and emergent approaches—will likely extend and refine this taxonomy even further.
