<h1>What is APRA<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-apra" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>APRA stands for the <strong>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority</strong>. It is an independent statutory authority in Australia that supervises institutions across banking, insurance, and superannuation (pension funds). APRA’s primary role is to ensure the financial safety and stability of these institutions, protecting the interests of depositors, policyholders, and superannuation fund members.
Established in 1998, APRA also plays a key role in developing regulatory frameworks and ensuring that financial institutions operate in a sound manner while managing risks effectively.</p>
<p>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has established comprehensive guidelines to ensure that banks and other financial institutions manage data effectively, especially when implementing machine learning (ML) and data science models.</p>
<p>Below is a revised version of the document with clear segregation between <strong>Data Standards</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning (ML) Model Standards</strong>. This revision incorporates additional details, aligns with APRA guidelines, and reflects industry best practices.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Machine Learning Model Governance and Classification<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-machine-learning-model-governance-and-classification" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While APRA does not prescribe a specific classification scheme for machine learning and data science models, robust model risk management is critical to ensuring that model-related risks are identified, monitored, and mitigated effectively. This section outlines best practices for classifying ML models and managing their associated risks.</p>
<section id="a-model-classification-criteria">
<h3>A. Model Classification Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#a-model-classification-criteria" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>ML models should be classified based on their potential impact on business decisions, operational risk, and the sensitivity of data involved. Consider the following dimensions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Model Complexity and Usage:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Criticality:</strong> Models that are integral to high-stakes decision-making (e.g., credit scoring, fraud detection, risk assessment) should be considered highly critical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complexity:</strong> More complex models (e.g., deep learning models or those with numerous input variables) require more rigorous validation, documentation, and oversight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Assess whether model decisions directly influence financial outcomes or operational efficiency.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Sensitivity:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Input/Output Data:</strong> Models processing highly sensitive or confidential data inherit higher risk and must adhere to the same data security standards outlined above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Evaluate the reliability and quality of the data used to train and run the model, as poor data quality can lead to significant errors.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Impact:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Risk Exposure:</strong> Consider the potential for model errors to disrupt operations, lead to financial loss, or impact customer outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Ensure robust back-testing, monitoring, and fallback strategies are in place to address possible failures.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="b-model-risk-management-controls">
<h3>B. Model Risk Management Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#b-model-risk-management-controls" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Based on the classification, the following controls should be applied to manage ML model risks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Model Development and Validation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Robust Documentation:</strong> Document model assumptions, methodologies, data sources, and limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent Validation:</strong> Require independent model reviews and validations, particularly for models deemed highly critical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Implement stress testing and scenario analysis to assess model performance under extreme conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Monitoring and Performance Management:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Regular Review:</strong> Establish periodic reviews of model performance and recalibrate models as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Use real-time monitoring systems to detect model drift or unexpected behaviors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Maintain detailed audit trails for model changes and decision outputs.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Governance and Oversight:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Risk Committees:</strong> Form model risk committees to oversee the governance, validation, and deployment of ML models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance Checks:</strong> Ensure that model development and use comply with internal policies, APRA standards, and relevant regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change Management:</strong> Apply formal change management processes for model updates, including comprehensive impact assessments.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="c-integration-with-data-governance">
<h3>C. Integration with Data Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#c-integration-with-data-governance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that ML models are intrinsically linked to the data they process, banks should integrate model risk management with their data governance framework:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Data Sensitivity Mapping:</strong> Align model classifications with the sensitivity levels of the data being used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Disciplinary Coordination:</strong> Foster collaboration between data governance, IT security, and model risk teams to ensure consistency across controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enterprise Risk Management:</strong> Incorporate both data and model risks into the overall enterprise risk management strategy to address systemic vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<hr class="docutils" />
<section id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>By clearly segregating <strong>Data Governance and Classification</strong> from <strong>Machine Learning Model Governance and Classification</strong>, banks can apply tailored controls to manage distinct risk profiles effectively:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Data Governance</strong> focuses on protecting information assets by categorizing data (Highly Sensitive, Sensitive, Internal Use, Public) and implementing appropriate security controls and data management frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ML Model Governance</strong> emphasizes rigorous model risk management through classification based on complexity, data sensitivity, and operational impact, supported by robust validation, monitoring, and governance processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Adopting this dual framework ensures comprehensive risk management that meets APRA’s regulatory expectations and enhances the overall security and reliability of banking operations.</p>

<h1>Risk Matrix in Banking Applications<a class="headerlink" href="#risk-matrix-in-banking-applications" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Below is an example of a risk matrix in tabular form, where banking systems are classified based on their <strong>Likelihood</strong> of risk occurrence and the <strong>Impact</strong> of that risk. You can adjust the specific examples to fit the exact systems in your organization.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p></p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>Low Impact</strong><br>(e.g., informational websites, non-critical internal tools)</p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>Medium Impact</strong><br>(e.g., support systems, internal reporting tools)</p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>High Impact</strong><br>(e.g., customer data processing, payment systems, core banking systems)</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><strong>Low Likelihood</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Low Risk</strong><br>- Minimal consequences<br>- Rare events</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Moderate Risk</strong><br>- Manageable consequences<br>- Infrequent events</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Elevated Risk</strong><br>- Some operational concerns<br>- Low frequency but higher impact</p></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>How to Use This Matrix:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Risk Identification:</strong> Use this matrix to map each system based on how likely a risk event is to occur and the potential impact on the bank.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Allocate resources and security measures accordingly. For example, systems falling in the <strong>Critical Risk</strong> cell should receive the highest priority for security investments and monitoring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Develop tailored strategies for each risk level. Systems in the <strong>Low Risk</strong> category might need basic safeguards, while those in <strong>Critical Risk</strong> require comprehensive controls and continuous monitoring.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This matrix provides a high-level overview that can be refined further based on the bank’s specific risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and operational context.</p>
<p>When developing a new software application, you can use the risk matrix to determine its risk category by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Identify the Scope and Functionality:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Business Function:</strong> What role does the application play in your organization? For example, is it a customer-facing app, an internal tool, or a critical payment system?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Sensitivity:</strong> What types of data will the application process (e.g., public information, confidential data, personal data, financial transactions)?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate Impact:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>High Impact:</strong> If the application manages sensitive customer data, performs core financial transactions, or is critical to operational continuity, it would be considered high impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Impact:</strong> If the application supports business functions but does not handle highly sensitive data or critical operations, it might fall into a medium impact category.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Impact:</strong> Applications that provide informational content or perform non-critical functions would be categorized as low impact.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assess Likelihood:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>High Likelihood:</strong> If the application is developed with new, unproven technology, has complex integrations, or has a history of similar projects encountering issues, the chance of encountering problems is higher.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Likelihood:</strong> If the application uses a mix of established and new technology, and there are known risks that can be mitigated through testing and controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Likelihood:</strong> If the application is built using mature, well-tested technologies with a proven track record and minimal complexity, the risk of problems occurring is lower.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Map to the Risk Matrix:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Using the previous matrix</strong>, place your new application in the appropriate cell based on the assessments of impact and likelihood.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Categorization<a class="headerlink" href="#example-categorization" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re developing a new customer-facing mobile banking app that handles sensitive personal and financial data. Here’s how you might evaluate it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> High</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> It processes sensitive financial data and directly impacts customer transactions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> Although mobile app development uses established frameworks, the app involves complex integrations (e.g., security, real-time processing) that introduce moderate risk.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mapped in the Matrix:</strong></p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p></p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>Low Impact</strong></p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>Medium Impact</strong></p></th>

<td><p>Elevated Risk</p></td>
<td><p>High Risk</p></td>
<td><p>Critical Risk</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this example, the mobile banking app falls into the <strong>High Risk</strong> category because of its high impact coupled with a medium likelihood of issues.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>For a High-Risk Application:</strong> Implement rigorous security testing, detailed code reviews, continuous monitoring, and thorough user acceptance testing. Engage in proactive risk mitigation strategies and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document &amp; Review:</strong> Document your risk assessment process and periodically review the risk status as the development progresses.</p></li>
</ul>
