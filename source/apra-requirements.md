# What is APRA 
APRA stands for the **Australian Prudential Regulation Authority**. It is an independent statutory authority in Australia that supervises institutions across banking, insurance, and superannuation (pension funds). APRA’s primary role is to ensure the financial safety and stability of these institutions, protecting the interests of depositors, policyholders, and superannuation fund members. 
Established in 1998, APRA also plays a key role in developing regulatory frameworks and ensuring that financial institutions operate in a sound manner while managing risks effectively.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has established comprehensive guidelines to ensure that banks and other financial institutions manage data effectively, especially when implementing machine learning (ML) and data science models.

## Data classifications

**Classifications of Machine Learning/Data Science Models:**

While APRA doesn't prescribe specific classifications for ML models, it emphasizes robust model risk management. This involves categorizing models based on their potential impact and associated risks. Key considerations include:

- **Model Complexity and Usage:** Assessing the complexity of the model and its application in decision-making processes.

- **Data Sensitivity:** Evaluating the sensitivity of data inputs and outputs, ensuring compliance with data privacy standards.

- **Operational Impact:** Understanding the potential consequences of model errors on business operations and customers.

These considerations align with global best practices, such as the Prudential Regulation Authority's (PRA) guidelines on model risk management, which advocate for enhanced model governance and validation frameworks. citeturn0search9

**Data Governance Requirements:**

APRA has outlined several standards and guidelines to ensure effective data governance:

- **Prudential Standard CPS 234 (Information Security):** Mandates that APRA-regulated entities maintain information security capabilities commensurate with the size and extent of threats to their information assets. This includes:

  - **Information Asset Identification and Classification:** Identifying and classifying information assets to understand their criticality and required protection levels.

  - **Implementation of Security Controls:** Establishing controls to protect information assets, ensuring only authorized access and safeguarding data integrity.

  - **Incident Management:** Developing and testing response plans for information security incidents to minimize impact and restore operations swiftly.


- **Prudential Practice Guide CPG 235 (Managing Data Risk):** Provides guidance on managing data risk, emphasizing:

  - **Data Governance Framework:** Establishing a framework that defines roles, responsibilities, and processes for data management.

  - **Data Quality Management:** Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and reliable for decision-making purposes.

  - **Regular Monitoring and Reporting:** Continuously monitoring data quality and reporting any issues to relevant stakeholders.


Additionally, APRA's recent initiatives, such as the 100 Critical Data Elements Pilot study, highlight the importance of:

- **Identifying Critical Data Elements (CDEs):** Recognizing data elements vital to business operations and regulatory compliance.

- **Implementing Consistent Data Controls:** Applying standardized controls to maintain data integrity and quality across the organization.

- **Integrating Data Risk into Enterprise Risk Management:** Incorporating data risk considerations into the broader risk management framework to ensure a holistic approach.

By adhering to these guidelines, banks in Australia can effectively manage the risks associated with machine learning models and ensure robust data governance, aligning with APRA's regulatory expectations. 

## Controles for data

In Australia, banks adhere to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) Prudential Standard CPS 234, which mandates the classification of information assets based on their criticality and sensitivity. This classification guides the implementation of appropriate security controls to protect data throughout its lifecycle.

**Controls for Each Data Classification:**

1. **Highly Sensitive (Confidential):**
   - **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls ensuring only authorized personnel can access the data. This includes multi-factor authentication and role-based access permissions.
   - **Encryption:** Utilize strong encryption protocols for data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitor access and usage logs to detect and respond to unauthorized activities promptly.
   - **Regular Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks.

2. **Sensitive (Restricted):**
   - **Controlled Access:** Ensure access is limited to personnel with a legitimate need, employing role-based access controls.
   - **Data Masking:** Apply data masking techniques where appropriate to protect sensitive information from exposure.
   - **Incident Response Plans:** Develop and maintain incident response plans to address potential data breaches effectively.
   - **Employee Training:** Provide regular training to staff on data protection policies and procedures.

3. **Internal Use (Protected):**
   - **Access Management:** Restrict access to internal stakeholders, ensuring data is not exposed to external parties.
   - **Secure Storage:** Store data in secure environments with appropriate safeguards against unauthorized access.
   - **Change Management:** Implement change management processes to track and authorize modifications to data or related systems.

4. **Public:**
   - **Integrity Checks:** Ensure data accuracy and protect against unauthorized alterations.
   - **Controlled Distribution:** Manage the dissemination of public data to prevent misuse or misrepresentation.
   - **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review public data to ensure it remains appropriate for public access and does not inadvertently disclose sensitive information.

APRA's CPS 234 emphasizes that the implementation of information security controls must be commensurate with:

- **Vulnerabilities and Threats:** Assess and address both existing and emerging vulnerabilities and threats to information assets.
- **Criticality and Sensitivity:** Apply more rigorous controls to assets classified as highly critical or sensitive.
- **Lifecycle Stage:** Consider the stage of the information asset within its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.
- **Potential Consequences:** Evaluate the potential impact of an information security incident on the entity and its stakeholders.

By aligning security controls with these factors, banks can effectively protect their data assets and comply with APRA's regulatory requirements. 

In Australian banks—under APRA’s guidance—the approach to classifying both data and machine learning models is centered around understanding the potential impact of a breach or error. Here’s how it generally breaks down:

### Data Classifications
APRA’s framework for data classification typically includes four levels:

1. **Highly Sensitive (Confidential):**
   - **Criticality:** This data is mission-critical and, if compromised, could severely impact the bank’s operations or its customers.
   - **Sensitivity:** Includes data such as personal customer information, sensitive financial data, and information critical to regulatory compliance.
   - **Controls:** Strict access restrictions, robust encryption (both at rest and in transit), continuous monitoring, and regular audits.

2. **Sensitive (Restricted):**
   - **Criticality:** Important for operations but not as impactful as highly sensitive data if compromised.
   - **Sensitivity:** Might include internal financial reports or moderately sensitive operational data.
   - **Controls:** Controlled access with role-based permissions, data masking where appropriate, and incident response plans.

3. **Internal Use (Protected):**
   - **Criticality:** Primarily for internal operations. The risk is lower compared to highly sensitive or restricted data.
   - **Sensitivity:** Data used for day-to-day internal functions.
   - **Controls:** Secure storage and access limited to internal staff.

4. **Public:**
   - **Criticality:** Low; designed for public dissemination.
   - **Sensitivity:** Information that is already approved for public consumption.
   - **Controls:** Ensuring data integrity and controlled distribution to avoid misrepresentation.

### Machine Learning Model Classifications

While APRA does not prescribe a fixed classification scheme for machine learning (ML) and data science models, banks are expected to conduct robust model risk management. The classification of these models is generally based on:

1. **Model Complexity and Usage:**
   - **Criticality:** Models that play a critical role in high-stakes decision-making (e.g., credit scoring, risk assessment) are deemed highly critical.
   - **Consideration:** More complex models or those with significant financial implications are subject to stricter controls and validation.

2. **Data Sensitivity:**
   - **Criticality:** Models processing highly sensitive data (as defined in the data classification) inherit a higher level of sensitivity.
   - **Consideration:** The more sensitive the input and output data, the greater the need for enhanced security and governance measures.

3. **Operational Impact:**
   - **Criticality:** Models whose failures or inaccuracies could lead to significant operational disruptions or financial losses are classified as high risk.
   - **Consideration:** This includes assessing the potential downstream effects of model errors on business operations and customer outcomes.

### Integration of Both Frameworks

Banks use these classifications to determine the appropriate level of controls:
- **For data:** The classification guides the security controls (e.g., encryption, access management, auditing).
- **For ML models:** The classification influences governance practices, such as validation frameworks, ongoing monitoring, and risk management procedures.

By aligning both data and model risk frameworks, Australian banks ensure that they protect sensitive assets and manage the risks associated with deploying machine learning models effectively.
