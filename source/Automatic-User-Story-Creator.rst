Sprint Planning AI Assistant
###############################

Building a **Sprint Planning AI Assistant** that listens to sprint planning discussions and automatically generates user stories requires a well-structured architecture. Below is a **comprehensive system design**, including components, workflow, and technology stack.


**********
Frontend
**********

A web-based UI that allows users (Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Developers) to review, edit, and approve generated user stories.

Features:

- **Live Meeting Transcription Viewer** – Displays real-time transcribed conversations.
- **User Story Drafts Page** – Shows AI-generated user stories for review.
- **Edit & Approve Interface** – Allows users to refine and approve stories.
- **Sprint Backlog Dashboard** – Organizes and manages stories for different sprints.
- **Notifications System** – Alerts users when stories are ready for review.

Technology Stack:

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js, Next.js, Vue.js
- **State Management:** Redux, Zustand
- **Real-time Data Handling:** WebSockets, Firebase
- **Authentication:** OAuth (Google, Microsoft), JWT-based


**********
Backend
**********

Manages meeting transcription, NLP processing, user story generation, and integration with Agile tools.

Components:

- **API Gateway** – Exposes APIs for frontend and integrations.
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Handles user login via OAuth (Google, Microsoft Teams, Jira).
- **Task Orchestrator** – Manages workflows like transcription, story generation, and integration.
- **Business Logic Layer** – Implements NLP-based filtering, LLM-based story generation, and validation.
- **Caching & Rate Limiting** – Reduces redundant LLM calls and prevents excessive API requests.

Technology Stack:

- **Backend Frameworks:** FastAPI (Python), Node.js (Express)
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT
- **Caching:** Redis, Memcached
- **Task Processing:** Celery, RQ, Sidekiq


**********
LLM Processing
**********

The core of the system, which listens to sprint discussions and generates structured user stories.

Features:

- **Speech-to-Text (Transcription Engine)** – Converts meeting audio into text.
- **Text Cleaning & NLP Processing** – Removes filler words, irrelevant text, and segments discussions.
- **LLM Integration for Story Generation** – Converts structured conversations into Agile user stories.
- **Vector Search for Contextual Enhancement** – Retrieves past sprint stories for better suggestions.
- **Fine-Tuned Prompts & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Ensures high-quality user stories.

Technology Stack:

- **Transcription Engine:** OpenAI Whisper, Google STT, AWS Transcribe
- **NLP Processing:** NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **LLM API:** GPT-4 Turbo, Claude, Llama 3, Gemini
- **Vector Database:** FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate
- **RAG Pipeline:** LangChain, LlamaIndex


**********
Integrations
**********

Enables seamless integration with existing meeting platforms and Agile project management tools.

Key Integrations:

- **Meeting Platforms:** Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams
- **Project Management Tools:** Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello, ClickUp
- **Real-Time Webhooks & Event Listeners:** Captures when a sprint planning meeting starts and ends.
- **GraphQL/REST API Clients:** Fetches sprint backlog, team assignments, and existing user stories.

Technology Stack:

- **Meeting APIs:** Google Meet API, Zoom API, Microsoft Graph API
- **Agile Tool APIs:** Jira REST API, Azure DevOps API, Trello API
- **Webhook Handling:** AWS Lambda, FastAPI Webhooks


**********
Database
**********

Stores conversation transcripts, user stories, and historical sprint data.

Components:

- **Relational Database (For Core Data)** – Stores transcripts, user stories, sprint details.
- **NoSQL Database (For Unstructured Data)** – Saves AI-generated responses, embeddings, and conversation logs.
- **Blob Storage (For Audio/Video Recording)** – Stores recorded meeting files for reprocessing.

Technology Stack:

- **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB, Firestore, DynamoDB
- **Blob Storage:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO


**********
Background Workers & Job Queue
**********

Handles asynchronous tasks such as transcription processing, AI generation, and integrations.

Features:

- **Task Queue System** – Manages async tasks efficiently.
- **Rate-limited API Calls** – Prevents exceeding API rate limits for transcription and Agile tools.
- **Scheduled Jobs** – Runs periodic tasks like sprint backlog cleanup, AI model updates.

Technology Stack:

- **Task Processing Frameworks:** Celery, Redis Queue (RQ), Sidekiq
- **Job Scheduling:** Celery Beat, Chronos, Kubernetes Cron Jobs


**********
Monitoring & Logging
**********

Tracks system performance, AI model response times, and debugging logs.

Features:

- **Observability Dashboard** – Monitors system health, error rates, and processing times.
- **Application Logging** – Records AI outputs, API requests, and error traces.
- **Error Tracking & Alerts** – Notifies developers when issues arise.

Technology Stack:

- **Monitoring & Metrics:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
- **Logging Stack:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry, Rollbar


**********
Security & Compliance
**********

Ensures data security, access control, and compliance with organizational policies.

Features:

- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts access to user stories and settings.
- **Secrets Management** – Securely stores API keys and credentials.
- **Data Encryption** – Encrypts stored and in-transit data.
- **Audit Logs** – Tracks AI-generated content and user edits.

Technology Stack:

- **Authentication & RBAC:** OAuth 2.0, Keycloak
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault
- **Encryption:** TLS, AES-256


**********
Workflow Example
**********

1. **A sprint planning meeting starts** – The system captures the audio via Zoom/Google Meet API.
2. **Transcription Engine converts speech to text** – Whisper or Google STT processes the audio.
3. **Text Cleaning & NLP Processing** – Irrelevant conversation is filtered out.
4. **LLM Generates User Stories** – AI suggests structured Agile stories based on the discussion.
5. **Stories are auto-categorized & prioritized** – AI classifies and assigns priorities.
6. **Users review and approve** – The frontend UI allows product owners to edit/refine stories.
7. **Stories are pushed to Jira/Trello** – Once approved, they are automatically added to the sprint backlog.
8. **Notifications are sent** – Alerts go out via Slack, email, or Agile tool notifications.
