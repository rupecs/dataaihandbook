# APRA Obligations for Banks in Building Predictive Models

This document outlines the regulatory framework established by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for building and managing predictive models in the banking industry. It details our sample project—predicting customer defaults—by mapping each regulatory obligation to specific implementation details.

---

## 1. Introduction

In developing predictive models (e.g., for forecasting customer defaults), banks in Australia must adhere to APRA’s regulatory framework. This framework mandates that models are developed in controlled, secure environments; validated through comprehensive testing; and continuously monitored and documented. Compliance ensures robust risk management, maintains internal controls, and upholds the bank’s financial stability. Non-compliance can lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional capital requirements, and potential APRA intervention.

---

## 2. Key APRA Obligations

The following 12 obligations outline the APRA requirements for model risk management. These serve as the foundation for our detailed implementation strategy.

1. **Model Risk Management Framework**  
   - Establish a comprehensive framework covering the entire model lifecycle—from development and implementation to ongoing monitoring and periodic review.

2. **Policies, Procedures, and Internal Controls**  
   - Develop detailed policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure models are fit for purpose and aligned with the bank’s overall risk management strategy.

3. **Secure Data Pipeline and PII Protection**  
   - Ensure data is handled securely throughout its lifecycle, including secure ingestion, proper classification, encryption (in transit and at rest), and protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

4. **Network Security with Private Virtual Networks (PVN) and Federated Access**  
   - Host critical systems and sensitive data within secure networks using PVNs, enforce network segmentation, and implement federated access controls for international resources.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring, Reporting, and Incident Management**  
   - Continuously monitor model performance and security, with mechanisms to detect, report, and respond to deviations or incidents, and timely notifications to APRA when required.

6. **Third-Party Risk Management**  
   - Assess and continuously monitor the security capabilities of third parties involved in managing information assets, ensuring they adhere to the same security standards.

7. **Model Validation and Independent Review**  
   - Subject all models—especially those used in critical risk assessments—to rigorous validation (back-testing, stress testing, sensitivity analysis) and independent internal or external reviews.

8. **Documentation and Transparency**  
   - Maintain comprehensive, audit-ready documentation covering model design, assumptions, data sources, methodologies, and limitations, ensuring transparency for regulatory audits.

9. **Governance and Oversight**  
   - Ensure active involvement from the board and senior management with clearly defined accountability structures for prompt identification, escalation, and resolution of model-related issues.

10. **Regular Monitoring and Reporting**  
    - Implement structured, continuous monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs), validation outcomes, and any material deviations in model performance, with regular reporting to senior management, the board, and APRA (where applicable).

11. **Capital Adequacy and Prudential Standards**  
    - Adhere to APRA’s prudential standards (e.g., APS 112, APS 113) for models influencing capital adequacy and risk-weighted asset calculations, ensuring model robustness and, when necessary, maintaining additional capital buffers.

12. **Response to Regulatory Changes**  
    - Stay updated on evolving APRA regulations and guidelines, proactively adjusting the model risk management framework and engaging with APRA as required.
