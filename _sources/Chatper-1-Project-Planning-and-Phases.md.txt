# Phases of a Data-Science Project

Applying Agile phases to a Data Science project involves adapting the iterative and flexible nature of Agile to the unique aspects of data-driven work. Data science projects often have more uncertainty, especially during the exploratory stages, so Agile’s focus on experimentation, continuous feedback, and incremental progress fits well.

Here’s how Agile phases map onto a Data Science project lifecycle:

---

**1. Concept / Ideation**  
- **Purpose:** Define the problem you're solving and identify potential data-driven solutions.
- **Activities:**  
  - **Problem Definition:** What business question or challenge are we addressing?  
  - **Stakeholder Discussions:** Collaborate with business leaders, domain experts, or product owners to align on goals.  
  - **Initial Hypotheses:** Formulate hypotheses based on intuition, prior knowledge, or existing data.  
  - **Feasibility Check:** Is the data available? Is the problem solvable with data science techniques?
- **Outcome:** Clear business problem statement and initial data science approach.

---

**2. Inception / Initiation**  
- **Purpose:** Set the foundation for the project, defining scope, data sources, and team roles.
