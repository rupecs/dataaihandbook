## 1. Executive Summary

The purpose of this document is to obtain formal security approval for the Predictive Default Model project, which leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to ingest, process, analyze, and produce a machine learning (ML) model for predicting customer defaults within a 3–6 month horizon. The project handles highly sensitive customer data, including personal and financial information, and applies robust data security measures both at rest and in transit. This design aligns with APRA’s Prudential Standard CPS 234, ensuring comprehensive data governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Description

The project involves creating a predictive analytics solution to identify retail banking customers who are likely to default on their loans or credit obligations. It encompasses the entire data lifecycle:
- **Data Ingestion:** Secure collection of raw customer data via Cloud Storage and real-time streaming with Cloud Pub/Sub.
- **Data Processing:** ETL and feature engineering using Cloud Dataflow, with processed data stored in BigQuery.
- **Model Development:** Training and validation of the default prediction model using Vertex AI.
- **Production Deployment:** Containerization and deployment of the model on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for scalable production serving.

### 2.2 Business Justification

The model supports proactive risk management by enabling early intervention for customers at risk of default. It enhances operational efficiency by optimizing credit risk management processes and supports compliance with stringent regulatory standards set by APRA, safeguarding the institution’s reputation and ensuring financial stability.

## 3. System Architecture and Data Flow

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

The system architecture leverages multiple GCP services configured with a multi-layer security strategy. Key components include:
- **Cloud Storage:** For storing raw customer data files. Data is encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) and in transit using TLS/HTTPS.
- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** For real-time data ingestion, ensuring that all streaming data is encrypted in transit and accessed only by authorized services.
- **Cloud Dataflow:** Executes secure ETL pipelines, cleanses data, and performs feature engineering. Pipelines operate within secure VPCs, ensuring encrypted data transfers and storage of intermediate data.
- **BigQuery:** Serves as the secure, scalable data warehouse for processed data, employing column-level security and CMEK for encryption at rest.
- **Vertex AI:** Supports the development, training, and validation of the ML model, ensuring that all data interactions are secure.
- **GKE:** Deploys the containerized ML model, utilizing private VPCs, secure network policies, and mTLS for internal service communication.

### 3.2 Data Flow Overview

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Customer data is ingested via Cloud Storage and Cloud Pub/Sub. Regional buckets are used for data residency and latency requirements, while multi-region buckets provide redundancy. HTTPS/TLS secures data in transit.

2. **Data Processing:**  
   Cloud Dataflow pipelines ingest raw data, perform data cleansing, transformation, and feature engineering. The integration of the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API ensures that sensitive information is masked or tokenized. Processed data is securely stored in BigQuery.

3. **Model Development and Training:**  
   Vertex AI facilitates data exploration and model training, ensuring that data extracted from BigQuery is securely transmitted using TLS. Detailed audit logs capture model training activities.

4. **Production Deployment:**  
   The trained model is containerized using Docker and deployed on GKE clusters, which are configured within private VPCs. Ingress is secured using HTTPS load balancers, and internal communications use mTLS. Persistent volumes and Kubernetes secrets ensure data remains encrypted at rest.

## 4. Security Controls and Measures

### 4.1 Data Classification and Handling

- **Highly Sensitive Customer Data:**  
  Classified as Confidential, customer data is stored and processed using strict encryption (CMEK for data at rest and TLS/HTTPS for data in transit). Data masking and tokenization are applied during processing to minimize exposure risk.

- **Intermediate Data & Model Outputs:**  
  Classified as Sensitive, these data artifacts are secured using role-based access control (RBAC) and detailed audit logging to ensure full traceability of data transformations.

- **Machine Learning Model:**  
  Classified as Critical due to its influence on high-stakes decision-making. Models are version-controlled, with rigorous testing and validation to ensure reliability and compliance with governance requirements.

### 4.2 Network and Infrastructure Security

- **Private VPCs & VPC Service Controls:**  
  All compute and data processing components are deployed within isolated VPCs to minimize exposure. VPC Service Controls add an extra security perimeter to prevent unauthorized data egress.
  
- **Secure Communication:**  
  Encryption in transit is enforced via TLS/HTTPS for all external data exchanges, while internal communications within GKE utilize mTLS. Load balancers are configured with HTTPS to ensure secure client interactions.

### 4.3 Monitoring, Auditing, and Incident Response

- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging are employed across all services to track system performance, security events, and data access patterns.
  
- **Audit Trails:**  
  Cloud Audit Logs capture detailed records of data access and modifications, ensuring compliance with APRA’s regulatory requirements.
  
- **Incident Response:**  
  A pre-defined incident response plan is in place, incorporating rapid detection, escalation, and mitigation procedures. The plan is designed to comply with regulatory reporting requirements in the event of a security breach.

## 5. Materiality Assessment

**Materiality Assessment** evaluates the significance of risks based on their potential impact on the organization’s operations, reputation, and regulatory compliance. In this project, the materiality assessment identified that:
- **Data Breach Risk:** Exposure of highly sensitive customer data could have a material impact on the bank’s reputation and regulatory standing.
- **Unauthorized Access Risk:** Improper access could result in regulatory non-compliance and significant financial losses.
- **Data Leakage During Transit:** Any interception of data may lead to severe consequences in terms of data integrity and confidentiality.
  
Given the high sensitivity of the data and the potential for significant adverse effects, all identified risks are classified as material. As a result, the security controls—encryption, strict access management, continuous monitoring, and robust incident response measures—have been implemented to mitigate these risks effectively.

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 6.1 Identified Risks

- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
- **Data Leakage:** Interception of data during transmission between services.
- **Operational Impact:** Inaccurate predictions due to model errors could affect credit risk management.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to adhere to APRA standards and internal policies.

### 6.2 Mitigation Strategies

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest (using CMEK) and in transit (using TLS/HTTPS and mTLS).
- **Access Controls:** Enforcing RBAC and least privilege principles restricts access to sensitive data.
- **Monitoring & Auditing:** Continuous monitoring, coupled with comprehensive audit logs, ensures that any suspicious activities are detected and addressed promptly.
- **Validation & Testing:** Rigorous model validation and continuous performance monitoring reduce the risk of inaccurate predictions.
- **Incident Response:** A defined incident response plan ensures that any security event is managed swiftly and efficiently.
